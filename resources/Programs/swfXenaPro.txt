               January 2000


Requirements:
-------------
- Windows 9x (Should work on NT but not tested!)
- Types.ini file should be located in the same folder!


What can Xena do for you?
-------------------------
Swifty Xena can,
- Extract uncompressed SWF files from executables, 
  including 16 and 32 bit projectors, flash3.exe, flash.exe
  or flash3.dl_ for trial version, Aftershock.exe
  and Director movies.
- Replace the SWF file in the executable or movie with another SWF
- Extract DIR and CST files embedded in Director projectors using 
  a special built-in function. [DIR file header is written to EXE 
  file start on extraction, (the DIR file is not relocated by Xena) 
  so you get a very fat DIR file! If you can remove the protection, 
  extracted files can be compacted by Director. You can open the
  file as a MIAW] {Xena does not really extract the DXR, it copies
  the EXE file and then writes the necessary header to that file so
  Director (or other apps) can read the file as a DXR file.}

Notes:
------
-Extracted files will be saved in EXE files directory.
-A backup file with the appended extension BAK will be
 created (in the same directory again) on replace operations.
-Both the backup file and SWF will be overwritten if 
 they exist.
-Replacement can only be done if the new SWF filesize is
 smaller or equal to the old SWF filesize.
-Swifty Xena Pro reads file definitions from file "types.ini",
 that means it can be extended easily for simple file types.
-This version will not extract SWF files version 5 and above.
 (with the supplied "types.ini" file)
-The version that is displayed is as read from the types.ini
 file. DIR/DXR format (at least the header) is not changed
 for D7 and, so,  D6 files are also displayed as version 7.
-The filesizes displayed for DIR/CST files are not the
 actual filesize. They're true sizes for the DIR/CST file.
 Extracted filesize always equals the projector EXE size.
-Doubleclicking a DIR/CST file runs the file with Director.
 Since DIR/CST files are protected, Director will complain
 about this and won't open the file.

Keep in mind:
-------------
-Test the extracted SWFs by doubleclicking on them in
 the extracted files list. Xena might get wrong sometimes.
-Original EXE file might check for integrity and etc so
 replaced EXEs doesn't (and shouldn't) work all the time.
 (though haven't seen one yet)


Trouble shooting:
-----------------
-if you get Access denied error, check if the file is 
 readonly. (On NT check Access rights for the file)
-if you get error 32, check if the EXE file is running.
 Exit the application before replacing any SWFs in it.
-Check if you have enough free space on your disk.

 . Flash3.exe and flash.exe (Flash 4) (you can replace 
   the splash SWF and others but i do not know if this 
   would be legal and strongly advice you not doing it.)
 . if you're using flash3 trial version then open flash3.dl_
   in the same directory as flash3.exe instead of flash3.exe
